# ClothCommons
An unofficial plugin for [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/), a code generator to create Minecraft mods. This plugin adds the data lists for the new Minecraft version(s), procedure blocks, global triggers, AI tasks and advancement triggers, but it doesn't add the code. Each generator needs to add them.
